# Calibrate. Good calibration means people can easily change sensitivities and expect them to behave the same between games.
# For 2D mouse games like this, the convention is to make it that a GYRO_SENS of 1 would mean the controller takes a full revolution to move the mouse from one side of a 1920x1080 screen to the other.
