# Useful settings for calculating a real world calibration for 2D (mouse moves a cursor) games
# (Any line that starts with # is ignored by JoyShockMapper)
# While 2D games have no obvious use for flick stick, it's still a practical way to calibrate JoyShockMapper such that the same other settings can be used between games.
# When calibrating 2D games, the goal is for one complete rotation of the flick stick to move horizontally from one side of the screen to the other. In games where this distance depends on the screen resolution, 1920x1080 is considered standard for consistency's sake.
# First, reset to defaults so we don't have to set values we don't care about

# Change this to whatever mouse sensitivity you have in the game you're playing
