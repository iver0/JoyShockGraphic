# JoyShockGraphic
JoyShockGraphic (from here on, “JSG”) is a user friendly, functional GUI for the [JoyShockMapper](https://github.com/Electronicks/JoyShockMapper) (from here on, “JSM”). It is aimed to help existing users of JSM write their configs in a more fluent, comfortable maner, and to help new users discover JSM without having to learn it.

The Sony PlayStation DualSense, DualShock 4, Nintendo Switch JoyCons (used in pairs), and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller have much in common. They have many of the features expected of modern game controllers. They also have an incredibly versatile and underutilised input that their biggest rival (Microsoft's Xbox One controller) doesn't have: a 3-axis gyroscope (from here on, “gyro”).

The goal of JSM is to enable you to play PC games with DS, DS4, JoyCons, and Pro Controllers even better than you can on their respective consoles - and demonstrate that more games should use these features in these ways.

# Installation
You will need to download JoyShockMapper. The latest version of JoyShockMapper can always be found [here](https://github.com/Electronicks/JoyShockMapper/releases).
