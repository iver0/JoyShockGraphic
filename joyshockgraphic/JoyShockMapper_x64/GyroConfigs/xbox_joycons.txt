# This configuration file sets up joycons held sideways as xbox controllers.
# Sticks are left sticks, and the button diamond is mapped, bumpers are bumpers
# and the back/start are mapped on the central buttons left and right respectively.
# The gyro serves as a motion stick for the controller right stick and both bumpers
# enable right stick click. There is no binding for triggers and the dpad.
# Additionally, The motion neutral can be set with stick click + start
# and gyro calibration with double clicking the larger control button
